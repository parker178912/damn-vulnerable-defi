## Challenge #2 - Naive receiver
There’s a tokenized vault with a million DVT tokens deposited. It’s offering flash loans for free, until the grace period ends.

To pass the challenge, make the vault stop offering flash loans.

You start with 10 DVT tokens in balance.

First of all, check the origin test script:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('hardhat');
const { expect } = require('chai');

describe('[Challenge] Naive receiver', function () {
    let deployer, user, player;
    let pool, receiver;

    // Pool has 1000 ETH in pool
    const ETHER_IN_POOL = 1000n * 10n ** 18n;

    // Receiver has 10 ETH in receiver
    const ETHER_IN_RECEIVER = 10n * 10n ** 18n;

    before(async function () {
        /** SETUP SCENARIO - NO NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING HERE */
        // Get three person in this test case.
        [deployer, user, player] = await ethers.getSigners();

        // deploy pool contract, attack contract and check variables.
        const LenderPoolFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('NaiveReceiverLenderPool', deployer);
        const FlashLoanReceiverFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('FlashLoanReceiver', deployer);
        pool = await LenderPoolFactory.deploy();
        await deployer.sendTransaction({ to: pool.address, value: ETHER_IN_POOL });
        const ETH = await pool.ETH();
        expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(pool.address)).to.be.equal(ETHER_IN_POOL);
        expect(await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH)).to.eq(ETHER_IN_POOL);
        expect(await pool.flashFee(ETH, 0)).to.eq(10n ** 18n);
        receiver = await FlashLoanReceiverFactory.deploy(pool.address);

        // set original balance of pool.
        await deployer.sendTransaction({ to: receiver.address, value: ETHER_IN_RECEIVER });
        await expect(
            receiver.onFlashLoan(deployer.address, ETH, ETHER_IN_RECEIVER, 10n**18n, "0x")
        ).to.be.reverted;
        expect(
            await ethers.provider.getBalance(receiver.address)
        ).to.eq(ETHER_IN_RECEIVER);
    });

    it('Execution', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR SOLUTION HERE */
    });

    after(async function () {
        /** SUCCESS CONDITIONS - NO NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING HERE */

        // All ETH has been drained from the receiver
        expect(
            await ethers.provider.getBalance(receiver.address)
        ).to.be.equal(0);
        expect(
            await ethers.provider.getBalance(pool.address)
        ).to.be.equal(ETHER_IN_POOL + ETHER_IN_RECEIVER);
    });
});
```
